Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\nBy 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world, launched multiple products and expanded their business globally.\n\nBellabeat has launched 5 products:\n1. **Bellabeat app**: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.\n2. **Leaf**: Bellabeat's classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. It connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n3. **Time**: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. It connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\n4. **Spring**: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. It connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.\n5. **Bellabeat membership**: Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users. It gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.\n\n# 2. Ask Phase<a id=\"ask_phase\"></a>\n\n### 2.1 Business Task<a id=\"business_task\"></a>\nThe purpose of the business task is to identify some trends in how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices, how these trends can be applied to Bellabeat’s customers and how they can help influence Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.\n\n### 2.2 Stakeholders<a id=\"stakeholders\"></a>\n1. **Urška Sršen** – Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer \n2. **Sando Mur** – Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder\n3. **Bellabeat’s marketing analytics team** – a team of data analytics \n\n# 3. Prepare Phase<a id=\"prepare_phase\"></a>\n\n### 3.1 Dataset Used<a id=\"dataset_used\"></a>\nThe dataset used for this analysis is [**FitBit Fitness Tracker Data.**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius). \n\n### 3.2 Accessibility and Privacy of Data<a id=\"accessibility_and_privacy_of_data\"></a>\nThe dataset is under the **CC0**: Public Domain Creative Common License – waiving all rights to the work and allowing for the dataset to be copies, modified, distributed and performed without asking for permission.\n\n### 3.3 Data Summary<a id=\"data_summary\"></a>\nThis dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty three eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.\n\n### 3.4 Data Organization<a id=\"data_organization\"></a>\nThe dataset, obtained from **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data**, consists of a collection of quantitative data presented in 18 long-format .csv files. Data was obtained between April 12 and May 12, 2016, a 31-day period, from 33 participants. All files contain IDs as primary keys and each file includes multiple variables, such as Activity Date, Time, Distance, Steps, Intensity, Calories, Weight, etc.\n\nThe files specifically are:\n1. dailyActivity_merged\n2. dailyCalories_merged\n3. dailyIntensities_merged\n4. dailySteps_merged\n5. heartrate_seconds_merged\n6. hourlyCalories_merged\n7. hourlyIntensities_merged\n8. hourlySteps_merged\n9. minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged\n10. minuteCaloriesWide_merged\n11. minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged\n12. minuteIntensitiesWide_merged\n13. minuteMETsNarrow_merged\n14. minuteSleep_merged\n15. minuteStepsNarrow_merged\n16. minuteStepsWide_merged\n17. sleepDay_merged \n18. weightLogInfo_merged\n\nSince our aim is to identify trends we will only focus on the analysis of **daily** and **hourly** data.\n\n### 3.5 Data Limitation<a id=\"data_limitation\"></a>\n\n* **No Metadata Provided**: Crucial metadata, such as location, lifestyle, weather, temperature and humidity, which would have enriched the context of the data collected, were not included.\n* **Missing Demographics**: Key demographics, such as gender and age, which are critical information, were not identified.\n* **Small Sample Size**: The sample size of just thirty users is not representative of an ideal population, especially when considering variations in health and lifestyle data across different segments of society.\n* **Data Collection**: The data collection period of only 31 days is limited in providing detailed recommendations. \n* **Obsolete data**:The FitBit Fitness Tracker data was collected in 2016 making the datasets obsolete for analyzing current trends.\n\n### 3.6 Data Verification<a id=\"data_verification\"></a>\nTo verify the data we will use **SQL** queries through the use of the R library **sqldf()**.\n\nWe install the packages and upload the necessary files.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(tidyverse)  # a must-have in R

Furthermore, research has shown that encouraging social support can increase physical activity among adults, so the app could improve social networking features, such as internal chats or the creation of team goals among users, to promote a exercise routine.\n2. The app could **customize** daily step goals based on users' profile, lifestyle and personal goals, and send notifications to encourage users to maintain them. **Adding features such as short games or interesting wellness information can foster a sense of gratification and consequently improve the level of user engagement** (as over time, the alerts sent by the app may lose their impact and be less interesting for users).\n3. For users who want to improve sleep quality, **the app may encourage users to spend time in bed** (as there is an extremely **high positive correlation of 0.93** between the amount of time spent in bed and actual hours of sleep), **perhaps practicing meditation or listening of podcasts to increase total sleep time.**\n4. It is important to carefully examine the reasons why users tend to reduce their usage time over time. For Bellabeat devices, features such as water resistance, a minimalist design, long battery life, and high comfort during extended use could incentivize users to wear them consistently throughout the day.","metadata":{}}]}
